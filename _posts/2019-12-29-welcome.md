When I was a kid I would read for several hours every day. I enjoyed graphic novels the most. But I also had fun reading text-only, sci-fi works. These days fantasy fiction is popular among kids and adults alike. 

I still love hanging out at the bookstores, but on the weekends, I have to compete with the kids for a seat at the nooks. 

Interestingly, I have never gotten a wrong answer for the question, "Where do I find Spice Melange?"

I highly recommend reading for three hours every day. And, if you ask me the spice question, I will know what you have been reading!
