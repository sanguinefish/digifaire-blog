We are in an era of artificial intelligence. It is only appropriate to celebrate June 18 as Artificial Intelligence Day in honor of the founding fathers of artificial intelligence:  Alan Turing,  Allen Newell, Herbert Simon, John McCarthy, and Marvin Minsky, among others who pioneered the development of the art. June 18 is the opening day of the Dartmouth Workshop, where experts gathered at the Dartmouth Math Department to brainstorm themes on artificial intelligence. Though no clear theme emerged at the workshop, the Dartmouth Summer is the birthplace of artificial intelligence. A lot more is to come as we have just set foot on this journey. So, how would you like to celebrate Artificial Intelligence Day? Please share your thoughts and/or if you would like to organize an event.
